# 🎄✨ Advent of Code 🎅 ✨🎄  

## 🎅 Welcome to My Advent of Code Wonderland! 🌟  

For years, I've been solving these delightful holiday-themed programming puzzles in the cozy seclusion of a private repo on a lesser-used account. But this year, I’m decking the halls and sharing the joy with the world! 🎁  

Whether you’re here to compare solutions, learn something new, or just soak up some holiday cheer, you’re in the right place. Let’s code our way to Christmas! 🎅💻🎄

## 🌟 What is Advent of Code?  

**Advent of Code** is an annual holiday coding tradition created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/about). Each day from **December 1st to 25th**, a new puzzle arrives to challenge your problem-solving skills and spread some festive magic. ✨  

- **Two-part challenges**: Start simple and scale up in complexity.  
- **Language-agnostic**: Solve them in your favorite programming language!  
- **Holiday vibes**: Expect fun, quirky, and clever scenarios, often involving elves, sleighs, and holiday mischief. 🧝‍♂️🎁  

Whether you’re a seasoned dev or just starting out, Advent of Code is the perfect way to level up your coding skills and get into the holiday spirit!

## Languages

My toolkit is a merry mix of:

- Python 🐍 (a classic choice for AoC puzzles!)
- JavaScript 🌐 (especially for trying modern frameworks).
- Go 🦫 (because I’m always looking to get better at it).
- Maybe a sprinkle of shell scripting for old times' sake!
- Who knows what other oddity may show up!!

Stay tuned to see which language I choose each day – I like to mix it up!

## 🎄 My Advent of Code History

I’ve been doing Advent of Code since pre-pandemic times (I think?), and it’s been a cherished annual tradition. 🕯️✨

I’ll be digging through my archives to add solutions from previous years as time allows. For now, I’m focused on 2024 – let’s make it the best year yet! 🎅
